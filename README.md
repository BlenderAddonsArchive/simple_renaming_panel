<h1>Introduction</h1>

<b> Simple Renaming Panel <b> is a small, but really powerful tool to rename more objects at once.

You have the choice which kind of objects will be effected by the renaming task, all or just selected objects,should it affect images, materials, objects, object data, bones or groups.
