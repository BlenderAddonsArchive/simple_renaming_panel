<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b> Simple Renaming Panel </b> is a small, but really powerful tool to rename more objects at once. The tool includes basic functionalities of adding suffixes, prefixes, search and replace, add suffixes depending on the object type and much more. Over the time more advanced features like a variable system were added. The tool gives a lot of power to you!  
You decide which kind of objects will be effected by the renaming task. Rename all or just selected objects, specify the affected object types like image textures, materials, objects, object data, bones or collections. This tool can be a real everyday helper. Renaming multiple objects is often needed and keeping the naming conventions can be tedious. The tool provides you with a clear feedback of what has been renamed. This tool is kept simple to be user friendly but offers everything you need to stay organized. </p>

<h1>Download and Installation</h1>

You can download the Simple Renaming Panel for blender 2.79 and blender 2.80 from the releases section <a href="https://github.com/Weisl/simple_renaming_panel/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.
Like any other Add-on, you can simply install it by going to <b> File &gt; User Preferences &gt; Add-ons </b> and click at the button <b>Install from File </b>. In the new opened window choose the .zip file of the addon and press <b>Install from file </b>.
<b>The Simple Renaming Panel</b> should now appear in your add-ons window and can be activated.

<h1> Renaming Panel</h1>

The renaming panel is the heart of the application. It provides you with a simple and an advanced UI option. It can either be found in the properties panel or by pressing the user defined hotkey.

<ul>
	<li> Choose which kind of objects you want to rename:</li>
	<li> Changes effect selected or all</li>
	<li> Replace names with a new name</li>
	<li> Search and replace </li>
	<li> Search and select </li>
	<li> Match case for the search and replace</li>
	<li> Use regular expressions to improve your search</li>
	<li> Add prefixes </li>
	<li> Add suffixes </li>
	<li> Numerate objects</li>
	<li> Trim string </li>
	<li> Data: Keeping the object data names clear and organized can be really painful in blender, this button simply renames the data according to the objects and adds a specified suffix.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Improved Basic UI</h4> 
I have improved the UI based on the input from Bookyakuno. This makes it easier to use, while keeping the efficiency from before. 

<h4> Advanced UI (Experimental) </h4> 
You can specify the number of leading zeros next to the new name input. Every # represents one 0. You can also disable the automated numeration completely. This is especially useful for the newly introduced variables. Additional Buttons allow you to easily add these variables and show you which ones are available for this renaming process. This UI is still WIP. 

<h4> Renaming Variables (Experimental)</h4> 
 
The biggest new feature are the renaming variables. They expand the functionality of the renaming panel drastically while keeping it fast and efficient. Variables are defined by the @ symbol. This is because other typical symbols like $ are already used for Regular Expressions. The variables can be generated by either press the button next to the input field or simply type it in. The current variables are:
<ul>
<li>	@f : filename</li>
<li>	@h: high poly (user defined, default = high)</li>
<li>	@l: low poly (user defined, default  = low)</li>
<li>	@b: cage (user defined, default  = cage)</li>
<li>	@d: date </li>
<li>	@u1: (user defined)</li>
<li>	@u2: (user defined)</li>
<li>	@u3: (user defined)</li>
<li>	@i: time</li>
<li>	@n: number </li>
<li>	@r: random</li>
</ul>
Currently only supported in Object mode

<ul>
<li>	@p: object parent (if it has one)</li>
<li>	@o: object</li>
<li>	@a: active object</li>
<li>	@t: type </li>
<li>	@c: collection (random order) </li>
</ul>
An arbitrary number of renaming variables van be used in any input field and at any position. Variables can be combined and used together with regular strings. 

E.g., 
@f_@t_object_@i  ([filename]_[objecttype]_object_[time]_[number]). Furthermore, it is now possible to deactivate the number at the end of newly generated names.

Note: 
Be careful by using the renaming variables in the Search input. It will only compare the strings. If you use the date variable @d it will only find the objects that have the current date and the same format. 

By deactivating the Numeration and using the custom number variable @n. It is finally also possible to rename many objects at once with a increasing number in the middle of the string. 

E.g., objeckt_001_high,  objeckt_002_high. objeckt_003_high. 
This can be useful for baking multiple high poly object onto one low poly object within marmoset or substance. 

<h4>Bone Renaming in Edit Mode</h4> 

Bones can now be renamed in the edit mode and the mode wonâ€™t change to pose mode. 

<h4> Search and Select </h4> 
The search can now be used to select objects. This uses works with the settings for renaming like only effecting selected and objects of a certain type. This feature works for object renaming as well as bone renaming in pose mode. 

<h4> Presets for the Prefix/Suffix by Type Panel </h4> 
The presets allow you to easily save different naming conventions for different object types and switch quickly between them.

<h4>Known Issues: </h4> 


<ul>
<li>Time: Ignores the current time zone and uses always Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</li>
<li>The selection order is still ignored </li>
<li>Be really careful with using @p and </li>
</ul>

<h4>Future:</h4> 

<ul>
<li>Test the renaming variable system further and handle more edge cases for the individual variables.</li>
<li>Improve the operation and variable descriptions </li>
<li>Improve the UI for selecting variables with different columns similar to the Editor Type dropdown</li>
<li>Add more user defined variable slots</li>
<li>Add and special variables for other renaming modes (e.g., especially for textures and actions)</li>
<li>Remove duplicate code for the simple and advanced UI </li>
<li>Refactor the code for adding new renaming variables </li>
<li>Add a Search and Select functionality</li>
<li>Add specialized renaming operators. (Baking Pair)</li>
</ul>
